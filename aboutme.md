I'm Zach Warren, a junior at Vanderbilt University. I am triple majoring in computer science, physics, and mathematics. 

My interests are many. Aside from coursework, I am currently learning SQL, statistical/machine learning, and will be taking on a project to combine those skills and learn how to use Tableau for visualization and Hadoop and Spark for big data analysis. I recently finished a project using a convolutional neural net to predict the classification of a galaxy from an image. Past projects involved modelling millions of points of dark matter using efficient algorithms, modelling and graphing galaxies based on redshift, brightness, and scale factor, among other things. I enjoy using computer science as a tool to analyze large amounts of data. 

I've always had an incurable curiosity about space travel, the nature of the universe and our place in it. 

I stay up to date on current events, reading and watching news from as many sources as possible.

My hobbies revolve around the ocean. Fishing, surfing, spearfishing, and scuba diving to name a few. I also have an insatiable itch to travel. I try to always have a book on hand.
