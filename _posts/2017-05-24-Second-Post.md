Second post. Been making good progress on getting the workflow up and running for remote work this summer. Using a fork for my work and then will submit a pull request to Richard if I have something I want him to add to our main repo. Finally, I understand how open sourcing works! 

I'm starting to use the emacs package Spacemacs for editing and I already see the value of these Lisp-based editors as far as commands and simplicity goes.

I've started reading <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">this</a> textbook for the basic understanding of what goes on within a neural net and it has definitely helped give me some clarity. Thus far I understand and have notes on:
<ul>
 <li>Perceptrons and sigmoid neurons</li>
 <li>Stochastic gradient descent</li>
</ul>

I'm also working on using Markdown so forgive me if the link above is broken or the style isn't quite right, it'll take a little time.

I leave at the end of the week for two weeks but by then I should have completed:
<ul>
 <li>first two chapters of the book above</li>
 <li>fully up and running workflow
 <ul>
  <li>working git and github repo</li>
  <li>slack channel</li>
  <li>blog and io page fully working (adding CV and about today)</li>
 </ul></li>
 <li>the simple handwritten digit NN from the book previously mentioned</li>
</ul>

Already have learned quite a bit from Richard and research and am very excited to get the project going!

Cheers.
