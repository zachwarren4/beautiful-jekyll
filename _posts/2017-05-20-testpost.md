Test post. Starting this page in order to keep track of progess on a project I will be working on this summer. The project is at first going to be using Neural Nets to classify galaxies based on morphology. I hope that by the end of it I have a good understanding of how neural nets work and a better understanding of the usages and importance of galaxy classification.

Right know, I know:
<ul>
	<li>the importance of well-structured data sets</li>
	<li>the basic idea behind a neural net</li>
		<li>the input to target through layers</li>
	<li>the basics of galaxy morphology</li>
</ul>

I have basically no Markdown, HTML, or CSS skill which I hope this blog will help me get a grip on as I think having a page like this will be very useful in the future.
I'm working with Richard Galvez, a postdoc at Vanderbilt. We'll be working together remotely which I think is good experience in today's world.
Cheers.
